Also, I'm really looking forward to the ability to do axis trimming of variable fonts some time in the future, so it would be great to try switching to harfbuzz.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't have any practical experience with this module or harfbuzz itself, but it looks like the subsetting features aren't exposed?\"}},\n",

       "    'body': \"Hey, I read that harfbuzz is gaining support for font subsetting and is working towards replacing `pyftsubset` from fonttools: https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/projects/4\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm not sure what the status of that effort is, but I'm drooling over the idea of using it in [subfont](https://www.npmjs.com/package/subfont) without shelling out to python. Also, I'm really looking forward to the ability to do axis trimming of variable fonts some time in the future, so it would be great to try switching to harfbuzz.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't have any practical experience with this module or harfbuzz itself, but it looks like the subsetting features aren't exposed?\"},\n",
